Efficient global supply chains see spiking importance in recent years as a product of
rising geopolitical tensions, increasing digitalization, and remnant effects from the COVID-19
pandemic. Ultimately, the core task of supply chain management comes down to the NP-hard
generalized assignment problem (GAP): finding the optimal assignment of a set of tasks to a set
of agents to maximize global profit while adhering to each agent budget. Quantum computing, a
rapidly developing field utilizing quantum mechanics, can solve multivariable combinatorial
optimization problems such as the GAP with greater speed and accuracy than classical
computers. Our research develops the first quantum annealing approach to the GAP by
implementing a quantum-hybrid D-Wave constrained quadratic model (CQM). We hypothesized
that our quantum annealing techniques could yield highly accurate results rivaling classical
algorithms in a reasonable timespan. In conjunction with leading combinatorial heuristics for the
GAP, our latter approach showed strong results, attaining a mean percent error of 2.78% with
respect to a dataset of classically-derived optimum theoretical bounds while possessing
exponentially greater speeds than our brute-force baseline. We conclude that quantum annealing
performs exceptionally well in quality and speed for the GAP. Under our novel quantum models
for the GAP, utilizing greater contemporary computing power and future quantum advancements
could improve the best optimizations for this core paradigm of supply chains beyond any
classical computing alternatives. Effective global supply chains are critical enablers of the UN
Sustainable Development Goals by reducing carbon footprint, promoting circular economy
strategies, and ushering equitable economic prosperity.
